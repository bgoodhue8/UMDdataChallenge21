## Background
University of Maryland’s Joint Program in Survey Methodology and Carnegie Mellon
University’s Delphi Research Group, collaborated with Facebook to invite people
to participate in surveys that ask about how they are feeling, including any 
symptoms they or members of their household have experienced and their risk 
factors for contracting COVID-19. The surveys are designed to provide valuable
information to help monitor and forecast how COVID-19 may be spreading, 
without compromising the privacy of the people who took the surveys. Facebook
does not share who took the surveys with our academic partners, and the 
universities do not share individual survey responses with Facebook. With
over 2 billion people on Facebook, Data Challenge Competitors are in a 
unique position to use the data to study COVID-19, such as how the pandemic
is affecting population movement trends, and understand which areas may be
at risk of an outbreak based on population characteristics and symptoms. 


## Abstract
"Our research aims to identify and analyse the relationships between COVID-19 
indicators from the UMD COVID-19 World Survey Data API to inform the audience 
about certain patterns and trends we found. The COVID-19 World Survey Data API
contains 21 indicators recorded from a Facebook survey answered from around the 
world. We automated a script to consolidate the data for each country through 
iterative API calls. Each CSV file contains 23 columns including fields such as
country name, date of each reporting, and the smoothed data for each of the 21 
indicators on each date.  We will cross compare the indicator values between 
countries to find insights into how their response to the pandemic affected 
these indicators, and how these indicators may uniquely impact one another in
each country we analyze. This format of data also allows us to perform time 
series analysis. Using data visualization tools will allow us the ability to 
express our findings of our technical work for the general public to easily 
understand and interpret. Our analysis can help to prepare for a rise or fall 
in people experiencing symptoms and ultimately help policymakers and Public 
health officials in determining which country or region would benefit the most
from added healthcare assistance."
